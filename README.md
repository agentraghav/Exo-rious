## How It Works :- 

You need a web server. I used python to initiate a web server.

Check python version in your operating system . Type following commands in your command prompt .

```
> python --version
```
```
> Python 3.6.5
```
Now through cmd go to your exo-rious project directory and then create a local server using these commands .

```
> python -m http.server
```
```
> Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
Now open localhost:8000/ in your web browser
